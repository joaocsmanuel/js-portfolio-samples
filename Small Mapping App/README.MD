#Small Mapping App
Just a small mapping app using JavaScript for ArcGIS, that I have been working on, with US states census information (the layer can change).
Has several functionalities, like search address, bookmarks, content table, records table.

##Getting Started
No need for installing.

Just open index.html on a browser and explore the functionalities.

In the code, variables have a prefix type, except argument functions:
* o - Object
* arr - Array

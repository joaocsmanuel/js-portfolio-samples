#Product Inventory Project
Small application which manages an inventory of products. The product class has a price, id, and quantity on hand and an inventory which keeps track of various products and can sum up the inventory value.

##Getting Started

Just open app.html on a browser, press F12, and check the console for the results.

var food = new Inventory("food", []);
food.addNewProduct(new Product(1, 7, 100));
food.addNewProduct(new Product(2, 10, 300));
food.addNewProduct(new Product(3, 5, 55));
food.updateQuantityProduct(1, 50, "remove");
food.removeProduct(2)
